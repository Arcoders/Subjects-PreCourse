- http://blog.udacity.com/2014/12/front-end-vs-back-end-vs-full-stack-web-developers.html

**What I can use for work?**
- We use the <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/">Google Developers Tools</a>, a simple and minimal IDE avaiable in Google Chrome for test your code and see the result, we can modify any element of HTML in the current page too for see the changes without affect the original code. 

1. *How to access?*

2. *Console.*

- For developer our code, we use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text </a>, for make simply test we can use the GDT directly, but our code must be built always with Sublime Text.
-> *Remember save your code file with **.js** extension!*

- It's good practice save all your exercise solutions, with a less comment about what your code do. The comments in Javascript are written with "//" before the comment, this make a non executable line, is only for information about your code, for you and for other who can see it.

```
//Example: 
//This is my exercise, this code pass two numbers as a parameter in function and returns the sum.

function sum(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
```

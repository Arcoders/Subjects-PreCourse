## Challenges Study Sessions
 
1) Calculator!
Make a calculator, a single function program to which you will pass two numbers, and will display by console its sum, subtraction, multiplication and division.

As EXTRA objectives:

- The results should be shown only with 3 decimals at most (if exist...).
- In addition, to be able to make square roots
- Contemplate that if, the user enters anything other thing than numbers, it should show an error
- Show results by storing them in an array along with the operands:

*Hint_* => results = [num1 + num2 = resultSum, num1-num2 = resultRest ....]

**PRO.**
-After do all operations, ask to user if wants make other operation with other numbers, the array should storage the results of first execution and second.
Good luck!

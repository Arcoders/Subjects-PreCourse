## Challenges Study Sessions
 
1) Calculator! 15/02 -> 21/02‚ûó
Make a calculator, a single function program to which you will pass two numbers, and will display by console its sum, subtraction, multiplication and division. The results should be shown only with 3 decimals at most (if exist...) and contemplate that if, the user enters anything other thing than numbers, it should show an error

As EXTRA objectives:

- In addition, to be able to make square roots
- Prepare the function for can accept more than 2 parameters...
- Show results by storing them in an array along with the operands:

*Hint_* => results = [num1 + num2 = resultSum, num1-num2 = resultRest ....]

**PRO.**
-After do all operations, ask to user if wants make other operation with other numbers, the array should storage the results of first execution and second.
Good luck!

2) Skylab Airlines! 22/02 - 28/02 ‚úàÔ∏èüõ©
Make the **interface of an airline**, this airline has 10 flights available for today (In object format), to begin with, flights are declared globally, when the function is called...:
. A message will be displayed *welcoming the user*,
. The user can see a *list of flights* in a simple but comfortable message,
. The user can know which is the *most expensive* flight and which is the *cheapest*,
. What is the average price of flights for today,
. How many flights have *stopovers*,
. And knowing that the *last 5 IDs* are the last flights of the day, shows the user the last destinations (only the name)

**PRO!:**

You must indicate to the function if you are admin or user. 

If you are *admin* the function, through the user prompt, you should:
- To be able to *create more flights*, up to 15, when the number of flights reaches 15, must show the error that the airport have collapsed.
- *Delete* flights by ID

If you are a *user*:
- You can s*earch for price*, higher, less or equal, a question will be displayed indicating which flight you want, *indicating the ID*, will show the selected flight information and a message: Thank you for your purchase, good day!
- Ask to user if you want *make other purchase*, directly, asking by the ID of the new flight

{id: 09, to: "Tel-Aviv", from: "Madrid", cost: 150,scale: false}
]
console.log(flights[0].to) //output: New York
